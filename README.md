This webpage is created with core HTML and CSS only. It is not responsive. I have used only media query make it mobile responsive. It took me almost 4 to 5 hours to complete this project.This project helped me to learn planning for designing web page, editing svg images, using media query. Images and icons are collected from [icons8](https://icons8.com/) and [iNeuron](https://ineuron.ai/) and [Boxy svg](https://boxy-svg.com/app) for editing svg images.
