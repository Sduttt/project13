12th August 2022
## Full Stack Javascript Web Development Course by [iNeuron](https://ineuron.ai/)

This website is created with HTML and CSS only. It is not fully mobile responsive. I will update this project very soon to make it mobile responsive. It took me almost 3 hours to complete this project.This project helped me to learn planning for designing web page, editing svg images. Images and icons are collected from [icons8](https://icons8.com/) and [iNeuron](https://ineuron.ai/) and [Boxy svg](https://boxy-svg.com/app) for editing svg images.
